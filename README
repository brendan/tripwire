Tripwire is a simple tool for watching a set of files/folders for changes
and then triggering a shell command to execute when a change occurs.

It was written because I love the concepts behind autotest and rstakeout
but the difference is that it will watch for the addition of files and
subfolders where those tools only seemed to register a set of files at
startup and never seemed to pick up on when you created new ones.

Tripwire uses very simple Dir.glob-ing
